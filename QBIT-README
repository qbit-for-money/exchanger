This readme contains info about extended version of cgminer (configured to work with bitfury devices).
New features:
	1. Options to control chip reset logic:
		--bitfury-reset-th to set bitfury reset threshold (in Mhs)
		--bitfury-reset-period to set bitfury reset polling period (in seconds)
		For example:
		sudo ./cgminer ... --bitfury-reset-th 500 --bitfury-reset-period 10
		This will configure cgminer to control hashrate of each chip every 10 seconds.
		If hashrate of appropriate chip is lower than 0.5Ghs, then send hard reset sequence (to this chip).
		These options will help you to make average hashrate higher.
	2. Detailed statistics in the bottom part of cgminer window.
	3. Slot (bank or chip chain) selection logic moved to separate module "bank.c".
